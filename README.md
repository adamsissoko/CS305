## Secure Financial Software Development for Artemis Financial - Adam Sissoko



#### Project Overview
In a strategic, six-month long engagement with Artemis Financial, a simulated consulting firm specializing in advanced financial technology solutions, I was designated as the lead developer to overhaul and secure their antiquated financial planning software. The primary objectives were to enhance security measures significantly and modernize the system architecture and user interface, while also focusing on scalability and maintainability.

#### Background
Artemis Financial's legacy system had been serving its purpose but was rife with outdated technologies and poor security measures, making it highly vulnerable to modern threats. Their end goal was to provide their clients with a secure, efficient, and state-of-the-art financial planning tool.

#### Security Analysis and Mitigation

##### Methodology
Before diving into the development phase, I initiated a multi-step security assessment process that began with a detailed threat modeling exercise. This was followed by static and dynamic code analysis using tools like Checkmarx and SonarQube, as well as manual reviews to identify weak security postures in the existing codebase.

##### Strategies Adopted
To offer the highest level of security, I implemented various cryptography algorithms such as AES-256 and RSA for data encryption and integrity checks. All identified vulnerabilities were systematically categorized and prioritized based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), leading to a well-organized, phase-wise mitigation roadmap.

##### Compliance Measures
Additionally, I ensured that the software was in compliance with relevant financial industry standards like PCI DSS and ISO/IEC 27001, integrating multiple layers of security including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and two-factor authentication.

#### Quality Assurance and Testing

##### Testing Protocols
To guarantee that the newly implemented security measures were up to the mark, I used specialized security testing tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and custom scripts to conduct penetration tests, SQL injection tests, and more. Post each development sprint, the application was rigorously tested for any potential new vulnerabilities.

##### Post-Deployment Monitoring
Even after the software was deployed, ongoing monitoring and security audits were planned to ensure the system remained secure and effective.

#### Functional and Secure Development

##### Programming Practices
I leveraged best practices in modular and object-oriented programming using languages like Python and Java, following SOLID principles for greater maintainability and future scalability. Code was meticulously commented, and version control systems like Git were employed to manage the codebase efficiently.

##### Validation Techniques
I deployed automated testing suites using JUnit for backend and Selenium for frontend tests, alongside manual testing sessions. Code coverage was kept above 95% throughout the project, ensuring an optimal balance between functional and security requirements.

#### Tools and Resources
- **Automated Testing Software**: For continuous integration and continuous testing.
- **Advanced Cryptographic Libraries**: Integrated to protect both data-at-rest and data-in-transit.
- **Version Control Systems**: Git was employed for code versioning and collaboration.

#### Deliverables for Future Employers
This project serves as a benchmark in secure and functional software development, and I can provide the following deliverables:

- **Codebase**: A fully documented, modular, and secure repository maintained on GitHub.
- **Security Assessment Report**: A granular-level report detailing vulnerabilities discovered, their impact, and the mitigations applied.
- **Project Documentation**: This includes an in-depth user manual, system architecture diagrams, and a performance metrics report.

By adopting a holistic approach, focusing equally on robust functionality and ironclad security, this project stands as a testament to balanced and effective software development, in strict adherence with industry best practices and standards.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
