## Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that makes financial plans for their customers. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operation and make their software safer for their users.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I did a good job of testing the software frequently, and keeping track of how the vulnerabilites might impact the project once it's released.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Learning how to use tests to check my code was extrememly helpful, and I'll definitely be using testing software in the future.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

You can increase layers of security by using algorithm ciphers and encrypting data that's being sent accross unsecured networks. I will decide which mitigation techniques to use by analyzing the requirements for the program, and looking at the amount of time that I have remaining until the deadling.

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I used testing software to make certain that the code and software application were functional and secure. After refactoring the code, I checked to see whether I introduced new vulnerabilities by running another test.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used modular coding, as well as comments, and these were very helpful because they made it very easy for me to find issues with my program, and eliminate them before I released it to the customer.

## Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I will show employers my code base, as well as the requirements page, to make it clear to them that my software was able to meet the requirements.
