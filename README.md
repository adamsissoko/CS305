## CS305: Secure Financial Software Development for Artemis Financial

### Project Overview

In a collaboration with Artemis Financial, a fictional consulting firm seeking to enhance its financial planning software, I was tasked with modernizing their existing system and bolstering its security framework. Artemis Financial sought to provide their users with a secure, efficient, and modern solution for financial planning. The key objectives were to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities and to modernize the system for optimal user experience.

### Security Analysis and Mitigation

#### Methodology

Given the sensitive nature of financial data, a rigorous vulnerability assessment was conducted. This involved comprehensive testing and scrutiny of existing code to identify potential security risks. A range of best practices were followed to ensure the software was not just functionally effective but also secure.

#### Strategies Adopted

Utilizing advanced cryptographic techniques, I was able to encrypt sensitive user data, ensuring its safety during transmission over networks. Vulnerabilities were categorized based on their impact and likelihood of exploitation, allowing for prioritized mitigation.

#### Quality Assurance and Testing

Upon completing each layer of added security measures, multiple rounds of security testing were conducted using specialized testing software. Post-refactoring, the application underwent another set of tests to ensure no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

### Functional and Secure Development

#### Programming Practices

Modular programming was adopted for ease of debugging and future scalability. Commenting was rigorously performed to ensure code readability, which facilitated a smooth debugging process. 

#### Validation Techniques

Code functionality was confirmed through automated testing suites. Any code modifications were subjected to a battery of tests, ensuring that the software remained both functional and secure through all development phases.

### Tools and Resources 

- **Automated Testing Software**: For code validation and security assessment.
- **Advanced Cryptographic Libraries**: Employed for secure data encryption.

### Deliverables for Future Employers

This project serves as an excellent case study for secure software development. I can present the following:

1. **Codebase**: A well-documented and secure code repository.
2. **Security Assessment Report**: Detailed findings from the vulnerability assessment phase.
3. **Project Documentation**: Demonstrating how the software met and exceeded client requirements.

By focusing on both functional requirements and security best practices, this project reflects a balanced approach to software development that is in line with industry standards. Thank you for considering this repository.
